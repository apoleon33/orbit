# Orbit
**🎵 Display your music on anything 🎵**

Orbit allows you to display the album cover of the music currently playing on a variety of existing mediums, from your terminal to a LED strip.

# TODO-LIST
- [ ] The actual LED part (duh)
- [ ] rework everything so that it's more customizable:
  - [ ] different effects
  - [ ] different ways to get the music data (spotify, LastFM, manually...)
  - [ ] different usage of the music data (display on LED strip, link with hue bridge and whatnot)
  - [ ] Web interface to customize everything
  - [x] config file
